Statergy Used to Guess Number:

We use gdb to change our guess value using the 'set var = x' command. 
We start with a guess of 0, using 'set guess = 0', and find our initial hamming distance. 
Hamming distance is the number of bit positions in which the two bits are different. 
Since initially our guess is 0, Hamming Distance gives the number of bits which are 1. 
For me, it was 11. Then we set each bit to 1 from LSB to MSB. 
If the Hamming Distance increases, it means that bit is 0. If it decreases, it means that bit is 1. 
We repeat it for all 20 bits until we reach our target.

Exact Sequence of GDB Commands Used:
gdb ./guessit

list (get first 10 lines)
list (get next 10 lines)
list (get next 10 lines)
quit (since we found our variable guess we need to modify)

21       guess = 12345;
22       h = hdistance(argv[1], guess);

In order to modify variable guess using gdb, we need to insert a break point at line 22, the line before the function hdistance is called. 
By changing the value of guess, we can get different values of hamming distance and reach our target.

gdb ./guessit

break 22
